## Scoring System

### Base Points: 100

Every correct answer awards **100 base points**.

### Streak Bonus: +25 per streak level

Build consecutive correct answers for bonus points:
- 1st correct: +0 bonus (100 total)
- 2nd correct: +25 bonus (125 total)
- 3rd correct: +50 bonus (150 total)
- 4th correct: +75 bonus (175 total)
- 5th correct: +100 bonus (200 total)

**Formula**: Base (100) + (Streak × 25)

**Example Streak:**
```
Question 1: Correct → 100 points (streak = 1)
Question 2: Correct → 125 points (streak = 2)
Question 3: Correct → 150 points (streak = 3)
Question 4: Wrong   → 0 points (streak resets to 0, lose 1 life)
Question 5: Correct → 100 points (streak = 1)
```

### Speed Bonus: +50

Answer in **10 seconds or less** to earn a speed bonus.

**Total Formula**:
```
Points = 100 + (Streak × 25) + (Speed bonus if ≤10s)
```

**Maximum per question**: 100 + 25×(streak) + 50

---

### Lives System

- Start with **3 lives** (❤️❤️❤️)
- Lose **1 life** for each wrong answer
- Running out of time = wrong answer
- Game ends when **lives reach 0** OR **10 questions completed**

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Wrong answer breaks your streak AND costs a life
- Sometimes guessing quickly maintains momentum
- Other times, use full 15 seconds to think carefully

---

### High Score Tracking

- **Global high score** saved across all sessions
- Persists even after closing browser
- Displayed on category selection screen
- "🎉 New High Score!" notification on results screen

**Tips for High Scores:**
1. Build long streaks (biggest point multiplier)
2. Answer quickly when confident (speed bonus)
3. Choose advanced difficulty (harder questions = same points, but more impressive!)
4. Focus on categories you know well

---

### Progress Tracking

**Per Category Per Difficulty:**
- Percentage completion calculated
- Progress bar fills on category cards
- Encourages comprehensive learning

**Calculation:**
```
Progress = (Correct answers / Total questions in pool) × 100%
```

**Notes:**
- Each category/difficulty combination tracked separately
- Progress updates after each game session
- Only highest progress percentage saved

---

## Study Strategies

### 1. Spaced Repetition

**Method:**
- Play Beginner level first
- Wait 1 day, play Intermediate
- Wait 2-3 days, play Advanced
- Return to difficult categories

**Why it works**: Spacing sessions improves long-term retention.

---

### 2. Active Recall

**Method:**
- Read question
- Try to answer BEFORE looking at options
- Select your answer
- Review feedback carefully

**Why it works**: Retrieving information strengthens memory more than passive reading.

---

### 3. Interleaving

**Method:**
- Rotate between categories in single session
- Don't master one category before moving to next
- Mix difficulties

**Why it works**: Prevents fatigue and improves discrimination between concepts.

---

### 4. Focus on Mistakes

**Method:**
- Note which questions you miss
- Review explanations carefully
- Revisit those topics in textbooks
- Replay category to test improvement

**Why it works**: Learning from errors is more effective than reviewing known material.

---

### 5. Pre-Exam Preparation

**Week Before Exam:**
- Play all relevant categories on Beginner
- Focus on weak areas

**3 Days Before:**
- Intermediate difficulty for all topics
- Note persistent weak areas

**Day Before:**
- Quick rounds on Beginner for confidence
- Advanced on strongest topics

**Day Of:**
- Light review, 1-2 quick rounds
- Build confidence, don't cram

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Maximize Your Score

1. **Build Streaks Early**
   - Answer first few questions correctly to establish multiplier
   - Even +2-3 streak adds significant points

2. **Speed Matters on Easy Questions**
   - Answer obvious questions quickly for speed bonus
   - Take full time on challenging questions

3. **Learn from Feedback**
   - Read explanations even when correct
   - Deepen understanding for future questions

4. **Track Your Progress**
   - Watch progress bars fill
   - Replay categories at 50-70% to boost completion

5. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Much faster than clicking
   - 1-4 or A-D for MC, T/F for true/false

---

### Effective Learning

1. **Don't Memorize Questions**
   - Focus on understanding concepts
   - Questions randomize; principles remain constant

2. **Use as Pre-Lecture Primer**
   - Play before class on relevant topic
   - Activates prior knowledge
   - Makes lecture more meaningful

3. **Review After Lectures**
   - Reinforce new material within 24 hours
   - Solidifies understanding

4. **Study Groups**
   - Share screen and discuss answers
   - Explain reasoning to peers
   - Learn from others' thought processes

5. **Supplement, Don't Replace**
   - GeoNet is a study tool, not a textbook replacement
   - Use alongside readings, lectures, and labs

---

### Time Management

**15-Second Timer Strategy:**

| Time Remaining | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| 15-11s (Green) | Read carefully, consider all options |
| 10-8s (Green) | Make decision if confident |
| 7-5s (Orange) | Narrow to 2 options, choose best |
| 4-1s (Red) | Make educated guess immediately |
| 0s | Automatic wrong answer |

**Don't Let Timer Stress You:**
- 15 seconds is usually enough
- Most questions answerable in 5-7 seconds
- Timer creates realistic exam pressure

---

### Drag-and-Drop Tips

**Desktop:**
- Click and hold firmly
- Drag smoothly (don't rush)
- Items snap into position
- Numbers auto-update

**Mobile:**
- Long press to activate drag
- Keep finger on screen while dragging
- Lift finger to drop
- Be deliberate (touchscreens can be sensitive)

**General:**
- Work from one end (oldest/youngest, first/last)
- Use process of elimination
- Don't rush—timer runs but accuracy matters more

---

## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Load

**Symptoms:** Blank page, error messages, no display

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → JavaScript → Allow
   - Firefox: about:config → javascript.enabled → true
2. Try different browser
3. Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers)
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

---

### Progress Not Saving

**Symptoms:** High score resets, progress bars empty after reload

**Solutions:**
1. Check if localStorage is enabled
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Cookies → Allow
   - Firefox: Preferences → Privacy → History → Use custom settings → Accept cookies
2. Don't use Incognito/Private mode (data not persisted)
3. Check browser storage isn't full
4. Ensure cookies not blocked for local files

---

### Timer Moving Too Fast/Slow

**Symptoms:** Timer inaccurate

**Solutions:**
1. Check system clock is accurate
2. Close resource-heavy programs
3. Restart browser
4. Try different browser

---

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working

**Symptoms:** Can't move items, items snap back, no drag action

**Solutions:**
1. **Desktop:**
   - Click and hold (don't single-click)
   - Drag cursor over another item
   - Release to drop
2. **Mobile:**
   - Long press firmly
   - Keep finger down while dragging
   - Try slower, more deliberate movements
3. Try different browser (Safari sometimes has drag issues)
4. Check touchscreen calibration (mobile)

---

### Visual Glitches

**Symptoms:** Overlapping text, misaligned elements, broken layout

**Solutions:**
1. Zoom browser to 100% (Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0)
2. Increase browser window size
3. Refresh page (F5 or Cmd+R)
4. Clear browser cache
5. Update browser to latest version

---

### Questions Repeating

**Symptoms:** Same questions appear multiple times in one round

**Note:** This is unlikely but possible due to random selection from pool.

**Solutions:**
- Questions randomly selected from pool
- Pools have 10-12 questions each
- Game draws 10 questions per round
- Some overlap possible on replays
- Not a bug—ensures variety across sessions

---

### Lost High Score

**Symptoms:** High score disappeared

**Causes:**
- Browser cache cleared
- LocalStorage cleared
- Clicked "Reset Progress"
- Switched browsers (data is browser-specific)

**Prevention:**
- Don't clear browser data if you want to keep scores
- Use same browser consistently
- Be careful with "Reset Progress" button
